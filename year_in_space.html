					<p class="info">
						On March 27th 2015, two astronauts, NASA astronaut 
						Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, 
						were launched to the ISS (International Space 
						Station) for a one year	mission to better understand 
						the effects of space
						on the human body. This research has profound 
						implications, because it will provide more 
						more information on how NASA will explore future
						manned space missions.
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						While the two are in space, NASA is conducting
						studies on the ground with retired astronaut Mark
						Kelly, Scott Kelly's twin. These studies will 
						involve many psychological and physical tests and 
						will serve as a comparison to the effects that
						his twin experiences in space.
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						A year in space can have incredible effects on 
						people. When speaking to TIME magazine, Kelly 
						said he almost forgot what life was like on Earth.
						“You definitely feel like you’re here and everyone 
						else that’s important to you and everything that 
						you care about and love is down there.”
