						On March 6th, 2015, NASA's Dawn spacecraft arrived at Ceres, the
						dwarf planet which lies between Mars and Jupiter. Once the spacecraft
						was around 38,000 miles away from the planet, it was pulled in 
						by the planet's gravity and became the first spacecraft to ever
						orbit a dwarf planet.
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						Dawn's orbit of Ceres comes shortly after exploring a giant asteroid
						Vesta, both of which are the largest bodies between Mars and Jupiter.
						The spacecraft has taken more than 16,000 pictures which have let us 
						learn more about the worlds that have been shrouded in mystery.
